# Tic Tac Toe using React, Typescript, and Redux
This project implements the [Tic Tac Toe game from React's tutorial page](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

# Scripts
## Development
To start the development server, run the following
```bash
npm run start
```
Note: this project disables the eslint for this particular script.

## Production
To create the production build, run the following:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Code quality tools
This project includes scripts like eslint and prettier to check and fix code style issues:
* `prettier:check`
* `prettier`
* `lint`

To run unit test execute `npm run test` or `npm run test -- --coverage` if you want to check for code coverage completion. These scripts are the same used by Create React App, See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
